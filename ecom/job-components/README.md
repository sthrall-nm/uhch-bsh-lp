# Job Components

## Introduction
This cartridge provides a toolbox for basic operations usually done in jobs. It is supposed to represent a successor for the [CS Integration Framework](https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/integrationframework)'s Standard Components. This project is part of the [Commerce Cloud Community Suite](https://developer.commercecloud.com/s/article/Commerce-Cloud-Community-Suite).

## Documentation
